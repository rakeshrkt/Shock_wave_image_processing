# Shock_wave_image_processing
Through image processing, located the shocks in the attached image. Further, calculated the Mach number by fitting a straight line  to the shock and assuming the shock is weak enough to be treated as a Mach wave.
# Result
Observed shock wave obtained by image processing of the attached figure is shown below:

Mach Number of the shock wave = 1.1264
